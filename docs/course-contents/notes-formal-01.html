<p>Quoting from an answer by <a href="https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/questions/866/which-proof-assistant-would-you-advise-me-to-learn-in-2022-considering-my-inte/884#884">Jason Rute on the proofassistants.stackexchange</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Foundations of mathematics can mean a lot of things to a lot of
people. Proof assistants present a sort of practical foundations of
mathematics, where one actually comes up with a usable set of rules
and axioms for doing mathematics formally in practice. Mizar and
Metamath (set.mm) use a set theory foundation which is more similar
to how foundations is taught in a typical university logic
course. HOL-Light, HOL4, and Isabelle/HOL use higher order logic,
which is a simpler type theory. And as we already mentioned Lean,
Coq, and Agda use dependent type theory.</p>

<p>(from Wikipedia:)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Kenneth Appel and Wolfgang Haken at the University of Illinois
announced, on June 21, 1976,[16] that they had proved the theorem.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Subsequently, there were some errors discovered and then corrected
in this algorithmic proof.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In 2005, Benjamin Werner and Georges Gonthier formalized a proof
of the theorem inside the Coq proof assistant. This removed the
need to trust the various computer programs used to verify
particular cases; it is only necessary to trust the Coq
kernel.”</p>

<p>Quoting from the introduction to Gonthier’s article in the <em>Notices</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Even Appel and Haken’s 1976 triumph [2] had a hint of defeat:
they’d had a computer do the proof for them! Perhaps the
mathematical controversy around the proof died down with their
book [3] and with the elegant 1995 revision [13] by Robertson,
Saunders, Seymour, and Thomas. However something was still amiss:
both proofs combined a textual argument, which could reasonably be
checked by inspection, with computer code that could not. Worse,
the empirical evidence provided by running code several times with
the same input is weak, as it is blind to the most common cause of
“computer” error: programmer error.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>…</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“For some thirty years, computer science has been working out a
solution to this problem: formal program proofs. The idea is to
write code that describes not only what the machine should do, but
also why it should be doing it—a formal proof of correctness. The
validity of the proof is an objective mathematical fact that can
be checked by a different program, whose own validity can be
ascertained empirically because it does run on many inputs.</p>

odd-order theorem</p>
<p>Wikipedia summary:</p>
<blockquote>
“William Burnside (1911, p. 503 note M) conjectured that every
nonabelian finite simple group has even order. Richard Brauer
<ol start="1957" type="1">
<li>suggested using the centralizers of involutions of simple
groups as the basis for the classification of finite simple
groups, as the Brauer–Fowler theorem shows that there are only a
finite number of finite simple groups with given centralizer of an
involution. A group of odd order has no involutions, so to carry
out Brauer’s program it is first necessary to show that non-cyclic
finite simple groups never have odd order. This is equivalent to
showing that odd order groups are solvable, which is what Feit and
Thompson proved.”</li>

<li><p>Kepler conjecture</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler_conjecture">Wikipedia summary</a>
&gt; In 1998, Thomas Hales, following an approach suggested by Fejes
&gt; Tóth (1953), announced that he had a proof of the Kepler
&gt; conjecture. Hales’ proof is a proof by exhaustion involving the
&gt; checking of many individual cases using complex computer
&gt; calculations. Referees said that they were “99% certain” of the
&gt; correctness of Hales’ proof, and the Kepler conjecture was
&gt; accepted as a theorem. In 2014, the Flyspeck project team, headed
&gt; by Hales, announced the completion of a formal proof of the Kepler
&gt; conjecture using a combination of the Isabelle and HOL Light proof
&gt; assistants. In 2017, the formal proof was accepted by the journal
&gt; Forum of Mathematics, Pi.[1]</p>
