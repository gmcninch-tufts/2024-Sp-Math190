It also features applications to number theory, graph theory, and representation theory of finite groups. Beginning with elementary material on algebra and number theory, the book then delves into advanced topics from the frontiers of current research, including spectral analysis of the DFT, spectral graph theory and expanders, representation theory of finite groups and multiplicity-free triples, Tao's uncertainty principle for cyclic groups, harmonic analysis on GL(2,Fq), and applications of the Heisenberg group to DFT and FFT. With numerous examples, figures, and over 160 exercises to aid understanding, this book will be a valuable reference for graduate students and researchers in mathematics, engineering, and computer science.},

Group theoretic considerations offer an analysis of variance like decomposition which seems natural and fruitful. A variety of inferential tools are suggested. The spectral ideas are then extended to general homogeneous spaces such as the sphere.}

  abstract = {"Advanced Calculus is intended as a text for courses that furnish the backbone of the student's undergraduate education in mathematical analysis. The goal is to rigorously present the fundamental concepts within the context of illuminating examples and stimulating exercises. This book is self-contained and starts with the creation of basic tools using the completeness axiom. The continuity, differentiability, integrability, and power series representation properties of functions of a single variable are established. The next few chapters describe the topological and metric properties of Euclidean space. These are the basis of a rigorous treatment of differential calculus (including the Implicit Function Theorem and Lagrange Multipliers) for mappings between Euclidean spaces and integration for functions of several real variables."--pub. desc.},

The theory is developed in terms of modules, since this is appropriate for more advanced work, but considerable emphasis is placed upon constructing characters. Included here are the character tables of all groups of order less than 32, and all simple groups of order less than 1000. Applications covered include Burnside's paqb theorem, the use of character theory in studying subgroup structure and permutation groups, and how to use representation theory to investigate molecular vibration. Each chapter features a variety of exercises, with full solutions provided at the end of the book. This will be ideal as a course text in representation theory, and in view of the applications, will be of interest to chemists and physicists as well as mathematicians.},
