# Report

*due [2024-04-26 Friday]*

Your report should be submitted as a *PDF* on *gradescope*. It should
be 3-53 pages (not including references or code).

This research is *not expected to be original or novel*. The main goal
is to get you to investigate and explain some interested mathematics.

Submission of your paper warrants that it is written in your own
words, and that you have not copied from any source without direct
citation.

Your report should include the following:

-  A brief abstract summarizing the results of your project.
-  Clear statement of the *problem* and the result(s) you will prove,
   including some context and background. Explain why the problems
   are related to class-material.
-  Careful proof of the main results.
-  References. (Again, this can just be a book).

# Video Presentation

*due [2024-04-26 Friday]*

> Your video presentation will be uploaded to a folder
> *tufts.box.com*, but I haven't yet set up the necessary folder. I'll
> update these guidelines when this is configured.

You will make a video recording of a 10 minute presentation describing
the problems and some of the results you consider in your report.

Your presentation should visually demonstrate some aspect of
mathematics involved in your report; you should give the proof of at
least one of the results described in your report.

I'm including some *suggestions* in the [*final project
recommendations*](final-project-recommendations.html).
