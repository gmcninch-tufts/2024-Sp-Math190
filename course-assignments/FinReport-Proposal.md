# Proposal 

*due [2024-03-29 Friday]* on *gradescope*.

The aim of the proposal is to articulate a clearly defined goal for
your analysis, and to briefly discuss how it you will carry out the
investigation. 

You should keep the proposal to a single page (and please use standard
paper- and font- sizes), with a second page for references if necessary.

-  Full *statement of the problem to be investigated*. This includes any
   constraints you may have to consider.
-  Clear *statement of the goal of your investigation*.
-  Concise description of what *computation(s)* you will need to do
   for the project.
-  Brief assessment of the *interest of the problem* (to you, or to
   others).

-  Cite a few *references* for the ideas and/or data of your
   investigation. (This can just be a book.)
