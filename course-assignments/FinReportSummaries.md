As indicated above, I'll create a folder at *tufts.box.com* for the
class Videos; the class will have *read-access* to this folder.  You
must *watch* (at least) two videos submitted by your classmates, and
write *brief* comments (a paragraph or two).

You must submit these comments in a PDF to gradescope by ~~[2024-05-06
Monday]~~ [2024-05-08 Wed].


- you should *identify* the 2 videos that you viewed.

- for each video you viewed, write a brief summary.
