1. Find the irreducible factors of the polynomial $T^9 - 1$ in
   $\F_7[T]$.
   
   (You should include proofs that the factors you describe are
   irreducible).
   

2. Let $0 < k,m \in \mathbb{N}$, put $n =mk$, and consider the subspace $C
   \subset \F_q^n$ defined by $$C = \{ (v,v,\cdots,v ) \mid v
   \in \F_q^k\} \subset \F_q^n.$$ Find the *minimal distance* $d$ of this code.
   
   > For example, if $n = 6$, $k=3$ and $m = 2$ then $$C =
   > \{(a_1,a_2,a_3,a_1,a_2,a_3) \mid a_i \in \F_q\} \subset \F_q^6.$$
   
3. By an $[n,k,d]_q$-system we mean a pair $(V,\mathcal{P})$, where
   $V$ is a finite dimensional vector space over $\F_q$ and
   $\mathcal{P}$ is an ordered finite family $$\mathcal{P} =
   (P_1,P_2,\cdots,P_n)$$ of points in $V$ (in general, points of
   $\mathcal{P}$ need not be distinct -- you should view $\mathcal{P}$
   as a *list* of points which may contain repetitions) such that
   $\mathcal{P}$ spans $V$ as a vector space. Evidently $|\mathcal{P}|
   \ge \dim V$.
   
   The parameters $[n,k,d]$ are defined by $$n = |\mathcal{P}|, \quad
   k = \dim V, \quad d = n - \max_H |\mathcal{P} \cap H|.$$
   where the maximum defining $d$ is taken over all linear hyperplanes
   $H \subset V$ and where points are counted with their multiplicity --
   i.e. $|\mathcal{P}  \cap H| = |\{i \mid P_i \in H \}|$.
   
   Gjven a $[n,k,d]_q$-system $(V,\mathcal{P})$, let $V^*$ denote the
   dual space to $V$ and consider the linear mapping
   $$\Phi:V^* \to \F_q^n$$
   defined by $$\Phi(\psi) = (\psi(P_1),\cdots,\psi(P_n)).$$
   
   a. Show that $\Phi$ is injective.
   
   b. Write $C = \Phi(V^*)$ for the image of $\Phi$, so that $C$ is an
      $[n,k]_q$-code. Show that the minimal distance of the code $C$
      is given by $d$.
	  
   c. Conversely, let $C \subset \F_q^n$ be an $[n,k,d]_q$-code, and
      put $V = C^*$. Let $e^1,\cdots,e^n \in (\F_q^n)^*$ be the dual
      basis to the standard basis.  The restriction of $e^i$ to the
      subspace $C$ determines an element $P_i$ of $C^* = V$. Write
      $\mathcal{P} = (P_1,P_2,\cdots,P_n)$ for the resulting list of vectors in $V$..
	  
	  Prove that the minimum distance $d$ of the code $C$ satisfies $$d =
      n - \max_H | \mathcal{P} \cap H |.$$
   

4. Let $C$ be the linear code over $\F_5$ generated by the matrix
   $$G = \begin{pmatrix}
   1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 2 \\
   0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 \\
   0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 1
   \end{pmatrix}.$$
   
   a. Find a *check matrix* $H$ for $C$.
   
   b. Find the minimum distance of $C$.
   
   c. Decode the received vectors $(0,2,3,4,3,2)$
      and $(0,1,2,0,4,0)$ using
      syndrome decoding.
