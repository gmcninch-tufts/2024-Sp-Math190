- [[Notes
  2024-02-21]](/course-contents/2024-02-21--notes-ECC--hamming+finite.html)
  Includes material on check matrices, on finite projective spaces and
  Hamming codes, and on finite fields.

- [[Notes 2024-02-22]](/course-contents/2024-02-22--notes-ECC--shannon+block.html)
  Includes material on Shannon's Theorem, and on block codes.

  (Actually, I've put all of the "finite field" material in the first
  set of notes, even though some of the material appeared in the
  second lecture. Seemed cleaner that way ... )
