# Textbooks

  In the course I plan to follow parts of the books [Mathematics in
  Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/)
  and [Theorem Proving in
  Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/).

  There is also
  [Functional programming in Lean](https://lean-lang.org/functional_programming_in_lean/title.html)
  which might be useful as well.


# Course repository

 I've made (another) `github` repository for the course,  to contain the
 Lean materials.
 
 [https://github.com/gmcninch-tufts/math190formalize](https://github.com/gmcninch-tufts/math190formalize)
  
 If you click that link, you'll see instructions for using `Gitpod` to
 interact with course materials.

 And you'll see instructions for installing Lean on your computer.

# Resources

- The definitive website for information on Lean is found here:
  
  [LEAN-prover community](https://leanprover-community.github.io/)

- introductory "games"
  
  There are some ["learning games"](https://adam.math.hhu.de/) available for Lean,
  including the [natural numbers game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4).

  Playing through these games allows you to begin interacting with Lean.
