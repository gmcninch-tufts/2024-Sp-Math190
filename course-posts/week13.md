No class this week (holiday on Monday; unused "Tufts make-up day" on Wednesday).

I'll be around for my office hours on Thursday and Friday.

Notes:

- I'm extending the due-date for the final project to [2024-05-03 Friday].
  (You need to submit both the *written* and *video* part on that date).

  After submission, I'm also extending the due-date on the remaining requirement:

  > You must *watch* (at least) two videos submitted by your
  > classmates, and write *brief* comments (a paragraph or two).

  >You must submit these comments in a PDF to gradescope by
  >~~[2024-05-06 Monday]~~ [2024-05-10 Friday].

  I've updated the [*guidelines*](final-project-guidelines.html).

- I'm not going to collect a `Lean` homework assignment.

- There are 3 remaining `Lean`-lectures, I plan to include some
  "exercise sheets" to accompany these (though I won't collect them).
