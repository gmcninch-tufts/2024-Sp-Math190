This week I plan to show you how to use Lean to prove basic assertions
in propositional logic. Along the way we'll learn a variety of `tactics`.

I hope to have you work on problems during the lecture. I'll show some
examples, have you work for a bit (hopefully giving some feedback) and
then I'll show some more examples.

# Lean via GitPod

See [this post](./lean-practical.md) for practical information about Lean.

I've created a second github repository to facilitate interaction with
Lean code (as [discussed here](./lean-practical.html)).

There are exercises in those files (that is what I hope we'll work on
during the lecture); I've put solutions to them in the sub-directory:

  - [https://github.com/gmcninch-tufts/math190-formalize/solutions/](https://github.com/gmcninch-tufts/math190-formalize/solutions/)
  
But you should try the problems before peeking at solution(s)!
