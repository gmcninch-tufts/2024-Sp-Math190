This week I plan to show you how to use Lean to prove basic assertions
in propositional logic. Along the way we'll learn a variety of `tactics`.

I hope to have you work on problems during the lecture. I'll show some
examples, have you work for a bit (hopefully giving some feedback) and
then I'll show some more examples.

There are exercises in those files (that is what I hope we'll work on
during the lecture); I've put solutions to them in the sub-directory:

But you should try the problems before peeking at solution(s)!
