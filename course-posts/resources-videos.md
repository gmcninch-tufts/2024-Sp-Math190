- Suggested video-editing software: [`openshot`](https://www.openshot.org/)

  (Probably it is unlikely, but if you are `linux` user and you also
  use `flatpak`, you can install via
  
  ```
  ~$ flatpak install flathub org.openshot.OpenShot
  ```
  
  cf. [https://flathub.org/apps/org.openshot.OpenShot](https://flathub.org/apps/org.openshot.OpenShot).)
