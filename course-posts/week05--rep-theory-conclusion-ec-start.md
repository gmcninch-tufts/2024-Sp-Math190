Remember the third assignment on representation:

I was originally planning to give a lecture on usage of the
computer-algebra package/language `GAP` to solve group-theoretic
problems, but I second-guessed this decision because I anyhow plan to
use `sage-math` in the discussion of error-correcting codes, and it
seems redundant to introduce both. But: if you are interested, here
are some notes that I made for a lecture a couple of years ago about
`GAP` usage (the notes in particular contain links for installation etc...).

I finished up the discussion of representation theory on Monday; see
below for the notes. In this lecture, I completed the remaining
"unfinished business" by giving the proof that the number if
irreducible (complex) representations of a finite group $G$ is equal
to the number of conjugacy classes in $G$. I also tried to give some
discussion of "applications of group representations to related parts
of mathematics" -- the notes probably don't give all details of that
discussion (ask if you want a reference!).

On Wednesday, I begin talking about *error-correcting codes*.
Remember that I listed a [few references to consult](resources-references.html).

I plan to sometimes use the computer-algebra system `sage-math` to
accompany the lectures/presentation.
