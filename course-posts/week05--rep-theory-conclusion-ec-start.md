Remember the third assignment on representation:

- [[problem set 03]](/course-contents/PS03--rep-theory.html) [[pdf]](/course-contents/PS03--rep-theory.pdf) due 2024-02-16

I've talked myself out of giving a full lecture on usage of `GAP`; if
you are interested, here are some notes that I made a couple of years
ago about `GAP` usage.

- [[Notes for 2024-02-12]](/course-contents/notes-RT-2024-02-12--Groups-and-GAP.html)

In fact, on Monday I will *finish up* the discussion on representation theory.
I'll post those notes, probably after the fact.

And on Wednesday, I'll begin talking about *error-correcting codes*.
Remember that I listed a [few references to consult](resources-references.html).
