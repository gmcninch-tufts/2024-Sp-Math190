# Resources

  The definitive site for information on `LEAN` is found here:
  [LEAN-prover community](https://leanprover-community.github.io/)

  Zulip chat instance 
  
  [LEAN on Zulip](https://leanprover.zulipchat.com/)

  Note that [zulip](https://zulip.com/) is sort of like *slack* or *discord*.

# introductory "games"
  
  There are some ["learning games"](https://adam.math.hhu.de/) available for `LEAN`,
  including the [natural numbers game](https://adam.math.hhu.de/#/g/leanprover-community/nng4).

  Playing through these games is a good way to get used `LEAN`.

# Installing Lean on your computer


  You'll find [installation instructions here.](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html)

## Projects

  Having installed `LEAN` it is probably worth reading about `projects` - see 
  [the discussion here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html) -
  and the package configuration tool `lake`.

# Some available on-line versions of LEAN



- [live-LEAN](https://live.lean-lang.org/)

- I hope/plan to set up (soon) use of [`git-pods`](https://www.gitpod.io/); more info as this progresses.



# [Learning resources](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html)

In the course I plan to do some combination of material found in
[Mathematics in
Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) and
[Theorem Proving in
Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/).
