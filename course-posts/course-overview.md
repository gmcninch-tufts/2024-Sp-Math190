- [Math 190 *Topics in
  Algebra*](/course-assets/2024-spring--Math190--topics-in-algebra.pdf).

  As a quick summary, I plan to cover three different components; each
  component should last about 4 weeks (8 lectures):
  
  - linear representations of finite groups
  - error correcting codes
  - formalization of mathematics
  
  In fact, you can see the (proposed) [schedule of lectures
  here](/course-pages/Math190--Lectures--AY2023-2024spring.html)
