Some of you have asked me questions of the form: "what is a good
linear algebra reference?"

I'm sure there are good on-line reference, but I don't have a good
list.  Here are some decent books at the level of a "*second course in
linear algebra*", though!



- [Hoffman and Kunze, *Linear Algebra*](https://archive.org/details/linear-algebra/)
  
- [Helene Shapiro - *Linear Algebra and Matrices*](https://bookstore.ams.org/amstext-24/)

- [Weintraub - *Linear Algebra for the young mathematician*](https://bookstore.ams.org/amstext-42/)
