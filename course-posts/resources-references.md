# References for *Representations of finite groups*

  - These notes [@milnej.s.GroupTheory] [Group Theory
    Notes](https://www.jmilne.org/math/CourseNotes/gt.html) are
    available on-line; Chapter 7 contains a treatment of
    representations of finite groups.

  - [@jamesRepresentationsCharactersGroups2001]
  
  - [@serreLinearRepresentationsFinite1977]
  
  - I hope to briefly discuss the Fast Fourier Transform, and I'll
    probably follow
    [@ceccherini-silbersteinDiscreteHarmonicAnalysis2018] for that discussion.

# References for *Error correcting codes*

  - [@huffmanFundamentalsErrorCorrectingCodes2003] is available electronically at *Tisch Library*

  - [@ballCourseAlgebraicErrorCorrecting2020]

  - These notes of Spence [@spenceIntroductionAlgebraicCoding2002] are
    [available here](/course-assets/Spence--Supplementary-material-for-coding-Theory.pdf)

  - [@tsfasmanAlgebraicGeometricCodes2007]

# References for *Formalization of mathematics*

  For our discussion of *proof assistants* and formalization of math,
  I'm going to use the `Lean` language; the `Lean` community web site
  is here:
  [https://leanprover-community.github.io/](https://leanprover-community.github.io/).
  
  Learning resources for `Lean` may be [found
  here](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html). They
  include the following:
  
  - [@avigadMathematicsLeanMathematics] [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/)

  - [@avigadTheoremProvingLean] [Theorem Proving in Lean](https://leanprover.github.io/theorem_proving_in_lean4/)

  - [@macbethMechanicsProof] [The Mechanics of Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/)
