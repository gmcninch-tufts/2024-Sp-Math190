# Student Engagement {#engagement}

   The student engagement score is intended to keep you involved in
   the course. It involves a weekly written submission, which I
   promise to read. You will earn the full student engagement score
   for the term if you make "good faith" student engagement
   submissions each week in which it is collected.

# Problem-sets {#problem-sets}

  You may work together with classmates while solving the *problem
  sets* -- you are free to share mathematical and computational ideas
  with other students in the course. However, *any work you submit
  must be written by yourself* -- do not directly copy anyone else's
  work!

  Your solutions/submissions will be marked to reflect the following
  criteria:

  - mathematical correctness
  
    Is the solution mathematically valid? 
  
  - explanation and exposition

    Have hypotheses been carefully explained?
