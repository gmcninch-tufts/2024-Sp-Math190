# final project submission 

  You should submit the report component of your project via gradescope.

  Please submit the *video* component of your project by uploading it
  to the course box-site; you should have received an invitation to
  that site on `tufts.box.com`.

  
  Here is what I would like you to submit to this box folder:
  
  - the video component of your project, in some reasonable [video
    format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_file_format), Please
    name the file containing your video using this format
	
	```
	Jane-Smith-project-video.mkv
	```
	
	(where `mkv` should be replaced by the correct suffix for you
	video format, and `Jane-Smith` should of course be replaced by
	your name).
	
  - the *abstract* from your report to the *box folder*. Use this format
	for the filename:
	
	```
	Jane-Smith-project-abstract.pdf
	```
