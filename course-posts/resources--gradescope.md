During the course, students will submit solutions to *problem sets*. 

These submissions will be made via [gradescope]; your work will be
read/marked by a course grader, and it will then be returned, again
via [gradescope].

Make sure that when you log in to [gradescope], you use the *school
credentials* option. You should select *Tufts University*, and you'll
then be able to login with your **UTLN**. The roster on [gradescope]
has already been populated using the roster on [canvas].

Note that submission to [gradescope] must be made in the form of a
*single* `PDF` file. If you plan to submit handwritten work, it will
need to be scanned first.  *Make sure to get a high-quality
scan*. More information about student submissions to gradescope is
[available
here](https://www.gradescope.com/get_started#student-submission). In
particular, you can find information/advice about getting a good scan
of handwritten work here:
