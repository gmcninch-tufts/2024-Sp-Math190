# Course Grading & Expectations   {#grading-and-expect}


Your grade in the course will be based on  problem sets,
engagement, and a *video project*.

Here are details on these course components:

- *weekly problem sets*, 

  Problem sets will be collected weekly on *Fridays*. [Here is the planned collection
  schedule](/course-pages/Math190--Assignments--AY2023-2024spring.html).

  The problems will be posted on the course website, and your
  solutions will be submitted to [Gradescope] -- see [these remarks
  concerning use of
  gradescope](/course-posts/resources--gradescope.html)

- *engagement*

  Each week (beginning in the second week) I'll ask you to make a
  written submission *on paper*.  I'll provide a prompt *in advance*,
  and you should write a paragraph or two in response and return it in
  class.

- *video project*

  You will make a 15-20 minute video presentation on an *approved*
  topic related to material covered in the course this term.
  
  You must submit a *proposal* for a topic.

  Your presentation should include rigorous mathematics.

  Suggested resources -- including a list of possible topics -- will
  be listed in this page of [resources for the
  video-project](/course-posts/resources-videos.html).

  After submission, each class-member's video project will be placed
  in a folder in [tufts.box.com](tufts.box.com) which will be readable
  by participants in the course. In particular, you will be able to
  view your peer's projects after submission.
  
  In addition to completion of your project, you must also view and
  provide comments on 3 of your peer's projects.

Your score in the course will be determined from these grading components by the
following (implicit) formula:

Table: **Grading**

| grade component |   percentage |
| :-----------    | :----------- |
| problem sets    |          50% |
| engagement      |          20% |
| video project   |          30% |

-------

Your *letter grade* is then determined from this score using [the
scheme described at this
link](https://math.tufts.edu/resources/grading-schemes).
