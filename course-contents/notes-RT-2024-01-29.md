**[in progress]**

Let $G$ be a finite group and $F$ an algebraically closed field of
characteristic 0.

# Some notational convention(s)

We will sometimes just write $V$ for a representation $(\rho,V)$ of a
group $G$, leaving implicit the mapping
$$G \to \operatorname{GL}(V).$$

One exception is when $(\rho,V)$ is a representation for which $\dim V
= 1$.  In this case, we denote this representation by the notation
$\rho$.  For example, for any group $G$ one has the *trivial
representation* $\mathbb{1}$: the vector space is simply the 1-dimensional space
$F$, and the mapping $$\trivial:G \to \operatorname{GL}(V) =
\operatorname{GL}_1(F) = F^\times$$ is given by $g \mapsto 1$ for each
$g \in G$.

Thus for example $\trivial \oplus \trivial$ is a two-dimensional
$G$-representation.

# Irreducible Representations

A representation $(\rho,V)$ of $G$ is *irreducible* (sometimes one
says *simple*) provided that $V \ne 0$ and for any invariant subspace
$W$ of $V$, either $W = 0$ or $W = V$.

**Theorem:**
:    Let $(\rho,V)$ be a finite dimensional representation of $G$.
     Then $V$ is isomorphic to a direct sum of irreducible
     representations:
	 $$V = L_1 \oplus L_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus L_r.$$

**Proof:**
:    First of all, we *claim* that $V$ has an invariant subspace which
     is irreducible as a representation for $G$.
	 
	 Indeed, we proceed by induction on the dimension $\dim V$. If
     $\dim V = 1$, then $V$ is irreducible since the only *linear*
     subspaces of $V$ are $0$ and $V$.

     Now suppose that $\dim V > 1$. If $V$ is irreducible, we are
     done. Otherwise, $V$ has a non-0 invariant subspace $W$ with
     $\dim W < \dim V$. By the inductive hypotheses, $W$ has an
     invariant subspace which is irreducible as $G$-representation.
	 This completes the proof of the *claim*.
	 
	 We now prove the Theorem again by induction on $\dim V$. If $\dim V =1$,
	 again $V$ is already irreducible and the proof is complete. [^1]
	 
	 [^1]: When $V = 0$ the result is still true, since $V$ is the
     "direct sum" of an empty collection of irreducible representations.
	 
	 Now, suppose that $\dim V > 1$. Choose an irreducible invariant
	 subspace $L_1 \subseteq V$ and use complete reducibility to write
	 $V = L_1 \oplus V'$ for an invariant subspace $V'$.
	 
	 If $V' = 0$, then $V = L_1$ is a direct sum of irreducible
     representations. Otherwise, $\dim V' = \dim V - \dim L_1 < \dim
     V$ and so by the induction hypothesis $V'$ is the direct sum $V'
     = L_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus L_r$ for certain irreducible representations
     $L_j$.
	 
	 Now notice that
	 $$V = L_1 \oplus V' = L_1 \oplus L_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus L_r$$
	 as required.


**Example:**
:    Suppose that $G$ is the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}/m\mathbb{Z}$. 

     If $\zeta$ is an $m$-th root of unity in $F^\times$, then
	 $$\rho_\zeta:G \to \operatorname{GL}_1(F) = F^\times$$ defined by
	 $\rho_\zeta(i + m \mathbb{Z}) = \zeta^i$ determines an
	 irreducible representation of $G$.
	 
	 Every irreducible representation of $G$ is isomorphic to
	 $\rho_\zeta$ for some root $\zeta$ of $T^m - 1 \in F[T]$.
	 
For $G$-representations $V$ and $W$, write
$$\operatorname{Hom}_G(V,W)$$ for the space of all $G$-homomorphisms
$\Phi:V \to W$.  If $V = W$, write $$\operatorname{End}_G(V) =
\operatorname{Hom}_G(V,V)$$ 
for the space of $G$-endomorphisms.

Notice that $\operatorname{End}_G(V)$ is a *ring* (in fact, an
$F$-algebra) under composition of endomorphisms.
	 
	 
**Theorem:**
:    Let $L,L'$ be irreducible representations for $G$.

     a. We have $\operatorname{End}_G(L) = F$.

     b. $\dim_F \operatorname{Hom}_G(L,L') = \left \{
	    \begin{matrix}
		1 & \text{if} \quad L \simeq L' \\
		0 & \text{else}
		\end{matrix}
    	\right.$ 
		
**Proof:**
:    (a). This is essentially the content of *Schur's Lemma*. We claim
     first that $\operatorname{End}_G(L)$ is a *division algebra*.
	 	
     For this, it suffices to argue that any non-zero element
	 $\phi$ of $\operatorname{End}_G(L)$ has an inverse.
        
     Since $L$ is irreducible and since the kernel of $\phi$ is
	 non-zero, $\ker \phi= 0$. Since $V$ is finite dimensional, it
	 follows that $\phi$ is bijective and therefore invertible.
		
     To see that $\operatorname{End}_G(L) = F$, it remains to observe
	 that when $F$ is *algebraically closed*, any finite dimensional
	 division algebra $D$ with $F \subset Z(D)$ satisfies $D = F$.

     Now (b) follows at once from (a).

# Permutation representations and homomorphisms
	 
Let $G$ act *transitively* on the set $\Omega$, fix $\omega \in
\Omega$ and let $H = \operatorname{Stab}_G(\omega)$ be the *stabilizer
of $x$*.  Since the action of $G$ is *transitive*, $\Omega = G.\omega$
is the $G$-orbit of $\omega$, and $\Omega$ may be identified with
$G/H$.


**Proposition:** 
:   Let $V$ be a $G$-representation and let $x \in V$ be a non-zero vector such that
    $hx = x$ for all $h \in H$.
	
	a. There is a unique homomorphism of $G$-representations
	   $$\Phi:F[\Omega] \to V$$ with the property that
	   $\Phi(\delta_\omega) = x$.

    b. If the $G$-representation $V$ is *irreducible*, then $V$ is
       isomorphic to a direct summand of $F[\Omega]$.

**Proof:**
:   (a). Every element $\tau$ of $\Omega$ may be written in the form
    $\tau = g\omega$ for some $g \in G$. Define $\Phi$ by the rule
    $$\Phi(\delta_{g\omega}) = gx$$ for all $g \in G$.
	
	Notice that $\delta_{g \omega} = \delta_{g'\omega} \iff g^{-1}g'
    \implies gx = g'x$, so $\Phi$ is a well-defined linear mapping.
	
	Let's check that $\Phi$ is a $G$-homomorphism. Let $\gamma \in G$.  We
	must argue that $\Phi(\gamma v) = \gamma\Phi(v)$, and it suffices to prove
	this identity when $v = \delta_{g \omega}$ is a basis vector in
	$F[\Omega]$.
	
	Now, 
	$$\Phi(\gamma \delta_{g \omega}) = \Phi(\delta_{\gamma g\omega}) = \gamma g.
	= \gamma (g.x) = \gamma \Phi(\delta_{g \omega});$$
	this shows that $\Phi$ is indeed a $G$-homomorphism.
	
	Finally, suppose that $\Psi:F[\Omega] \to V$ is any
	$G$-homomorphism with $\Psi(\delta_\omega) = x$. Then for $g \in
	G$, $$g x = g \Psi(\delta_\omega) = \Psi(g \delta_\omega) =
	\Psi(\delta_{g\omega}).$$ which shows that $\Psi$ is given by
	precisely the same formula as $\Phi$; this proves the uniqueness.

    (b). The homomorphism constructed in (a) is nonzero since $x$ is
    contained in its image. Since $V$ is irreducible, this
    homomorphism is *surjective*. Let $K \subset F[\Omega]$ be the
    *kernel* of this homomorphism.  By complete reducibity, there is a
    subrepresentation $W$ of $F[\Omega]$ such that $F[\Omega] = K
    \oplus W$.
	
	On the one hand, $F[\Omega]/K = (W \oplus K)/K \simeq W$, and on
	the other hand, the homomorphism $F[\Omega] \to V$ induces an
	isomorphism $F[\Omega]/K \simeq V$. Thus $W \simeq V$, so indeed
	the irreducible representation $W$ is a direct summand of
	$F[\Omega]$.

**Remark:** Let $\Phi:F[\Omega] \to V$ be the mapping of the proposition,
so $x \in V$ is fixed by $V$. If $f \in F[\Omega]$, then
$$\Phi(f) = \sum_{g \in G} f(g)gx.$$

# The Regular Representation
 
Note that the group $G$ acts on the set $\Omega = G$ by left
multiplication. The resulting *permutation representation* $F[\Omega]
= F[G]$ is called the *regular representation*.
     
Note that the action of $G$ on itself is *transitive*, and the
stabilizer $H$ of an element (say, $1 \in G$) is the *trivial
subgroup*.
	 
**Theorem:**
:    Every irreducible representation is isomorphic to a
     subrepresentation of the regular representation $F[G]$.
	 
**Proof:**
:    The Theorem follows at once from the Proposition in the previous
     section.


**Corollary:**
:    Up to isomorphism, $G$ has only finitely many irreducible
     representations.

**Proof:**
:    Write the regular representation as a direct sum 
     $$F[\Omega] = L_1 \oplus L_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus L_r$$
	 of irreducible representations $L_i$.
	 
	 For each $i$, let $\pi_i:F[\Omega] \to L_i$ be the *projection*
     onto $L_i$ for this direct sum decomposition, and notice that
     $$\operatorname{id}_V = \sum_{i=1}^r \pi_i.$$
	 
	 If $L \subset F[\Omega]$ is an irreducible invariant subspace, it
	 follows that for some $i$, $\pi_i(L) \ne 0$. Since $L$ and $L_i$
	 are irreducible, $\pi_i$ induces an isomorphism $L_i
	 \xrightarrow{\sim} L$.


# Characters and class functions

**We are now going to assume $F = \mathbb{C}$**

Let $V$ be a representation of $G$ and consider the $\mathbb{C}$-valued
function $$\chi = \chi_V:G \to \mathbb{C}$$ defined by the rule $$\chi(g) =
\operatorname{tr}(g:V \to V)$$ where $\operatorname{tr}(g)$ denotes
the *trace* of the linear endomorphism of $V$ determined by $g$.

> If $\rho:G\to\operatorname{GL}(V)$ denotes the homomorphism
> determining the representation, $\chi_V(g) =
> \operatorname{tr}(\rho(g))$.

**Proposition:**
:    The character $\chi$ of a representation of $G$ is constant on
     the *conjugacy classes* of the group $G$.
	 
Recall that a conjugacy class $C \subseteq G$ is an equivalence class
for the relation $$g \sim h \iff g = xhx^{-1} \quad \text{for some $x \in G$.}$$
Thus, a conjugacy class has the form
$$C = \{xyx^{-1} \mid x \in G\}$$
for some $y \in G$.

**Proof of Proposition:**
:    If $g \sim h$ we must show that $\chi(g) = \chi(h)$. But
     we have $g = xhx^{-1}$ so that
	 $\rho(g) = \rho(x) \rho(h) \rho(x)^{-1}$.
	 
	 Now the result follows since for any $m \times m$ matrices
	 $M,P$ with $P$ invertible we have
	 $$\operatorname{tr}(PMP^{-1}) = \operatorname{tr}(M).$$

Let us write $\operatorname{Cl}(G)$ for the space of
$\mathbb{C}$-valued *class functions* on $G$.

Thus for any representation $V$ of $G$, we have $\chi = \chi_V \in
\operatorname{Cl}(G)$.

We introduce a *hermitian inner product* 
$\langle \cdot , \cdot \rangle$ on $\operatorname{Cl}(G)$ by the rule
$$\langle\phi,\psi\rangle = \dfrac{1}{|G|} \sum_{x \in G} \phi(x) \overline{\psi(x)}.$$

Thus $$\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle:\operatorname{Cl}(G) \times
\operatorname{Cl}(G) \to \mathbb{C}$$ is linear in the first variable
and conjugate linear in the second variable.

**Proposition:**
:    a. $\dim \operatorname{Cl}(G)$ is equal to the number of conjugacy classes in $G$.
     b. The hermitian inner product $\langle \cdot,\cdot\rangle$ is *positive definite* on
	    $\operatorname{Cl}(G)$.

**Sketch:**
:    For a conjugacy class $C$, let $\theta_C$ denote the
     *characteristic function* of $C$; thus $\theta_C \in
     \operatorname{Cl}(G)$ and it is clear that the functions
     $\{\theta_C\}$ form a basis for $\operatorname{Cl}(G)$. This
     proves (a).
	 
	 For (b), consider two conjugacy classes $C,C'$ and compute:
	 $$\langle \theta_C,\theta_{C'} \rangle = \dfrac{1}{|G|} \sum_{x
	 \in G} \theta_C(g) \overline{\theta_{C'}(g)} = \delta_{C,C'}
	 \dfrac{|C|}{|G|}$$ where $\delta_{C,C'}$ denotes the "Kronecker
	 delta". Since $\dfrac{|C|}{|G|}$ is a positive real number, this
	 suffices to confirm that the inner product is positive definite.
