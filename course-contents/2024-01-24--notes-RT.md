# Invariant subspaces

Let $(\rho,V)$ be a *representation* of the group $G$ on the
$F$-vector space $V$.

If $W$ is a *subspace* of $V$ [^1], one says that $W$ is a
*sub-representation* of $V$, or that $W$ is an *invariant subspace*,
provided that $$\rho(g)W \subseteq W \quad \forall g \in G.$$

If $W$ is a sub-representation, then $W$ "*is*" itself a
representation of $G$ in a natural way, since $\rho$ determines a
group homomorphism $$g \mapsto \rho(g)_{\mid W}:G \to
\operatorname{GL}(W).$$

[^1]: The term "subspace" means "vector subspace". One might also say "$F$-subspace" to emphasize
      the scalars.

**Proposition:**
:    If $(\rho,V)$ and $(\psi,W)$ are $G$-representations and if
     $\Phi:V \to W$ is a homomorphism of $G$-representations then
     $\ker \Phi$ is a subrepresentation of $V$ and $\Phi(V)$ is a
     subrepresentation of $W$.
	 
# Recollections on vector subspaces and direct sums

Let $W_1$ and $W_2$ be $F$-vector subspaces of the vector space
$V$. We can form the *direct sum* $W_1 \oplus W_2$.

And the defining property of the direct sum tells us that we get a linear mapping
$$\phi:W_1 \oplus W_2 \to V$$
by the rule $\phi(w_1,w_2) = w_1 + w_2$.

Suppose the following hold:

- $W_1 + W_2 = V$ -- i.e. $\phi$ is surjective, and
- $\ker \phi = 0$ -- i.e. $W_1 \cap W_2 = \{0\}$.

Under these conditions, $\phi$ determines an isomorphism $W_1 \oplus
W_2 \simeq V$, and one says that $V$ is the *internal direct sum* of
the subspaces $W_1$ and $W_2$.

**Remark:** 
:   More generally, if $W_1,W_2,\cdots,W_n$ are subspaces of $V$,
    suppose that
	
	- $V = \sum_{i=1}^n W_i$, and
	- for each $i$ we have $W_i \cap \left(\sum_{j\ne i} W_j\right) = 0.$

    Then $V$ is the *internal direct sum* $V = W_1 \oplus W_2 \oplus
    \cdots \oplus W_n$.

**Example:**
:   Let $\phi:V \to V$ be a linear mapping with $\dim V < \infty$, and
    suppose that $\phi$ is *diagonalizable* i.e. that $V$ has a basis
    consisting of *eigenvectors* for $\phi$.

    Let $\lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_k \in F$ be the *distinct eigenvalues* of $\phi$,
	and let 
	$$V_i = \{x \in V \mid \phi(x) = \lambda_i x\}$$
	be the $\lambda_i$-eigenspace.
	
	Then $$V = V_1 \oplus V_2 \oplus \cdots \oplus V_n$$
	i.e. $V$ is the internal direct sum of the eigenspaces for $\phi$.


**Proposition:**
:   Let $W$ be a subspace of $V$ where $\dim V < \infty$. Then there is a subspace
    $W'$ of $V$ for which $V$ is the internal direct sum of $W$ and $W'$.


**Remark**
:   The analogue of the property described by the Proposition fails
    for abelian groups in general. Consider $A = \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$. For the subgroup
	$B = 2\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$ (of order 2), there is no subgroup $B'$ for which
	$A = B \oplus B'$.

**Sketch of proof of Proposition:**
:   Choose a basis $\beta_1,\dots,\beta_\ell$ for the $F$-vector space
    $V/W$. Now *choose* vectors $b_1,\cdots,b_\ell \in V$ so that $$\beta_i = b_i + W \in V/W.$$
	
	Let $W'$ be the *span* of $b_1,\cdots,b_\ell$; i.e
	$$W' = \sum_{i=1}^\ell Fb_i.$$
	
	We are going to show that $V$ is the internal direct sum of $W$ and $W'$.
	
    For $v \in V$, viewing $v+W$ as an element of $V/W$ we may write
	$$v+W = a_1 \beta_1 + \cdots + a_\ell \beta_\ell$$
	for scalars $a_i \in F$.
	
	Let $w' = \sum_{i=1}^\ell a_i b_i \in W'$. It is clear that
	$w=v - w' \in W$. Since $v = w + w'$ we have showed that $W + W' = V$.
	
	Finally the linear independence of the $\beta_i$ shows the only element
	of $W'$ contained in $W$ is $0$; thus $W \cap W' = \{0\}$ so that
	$V = W \oplus W'$.

With notation as in the statement of the Proposition, one says that the subspace $W'$
is a *complement* to the subspace $W$.

# Complements and projections

Given a subspace $W \subset V$ and a complement $W'$, so that $V = W \oplus W'$, we
get a *projection operator*
$$\pi:V = W \oplus W' \to V = W \oplus W' \quad \text{via} \quad \pi(x,y) = (x,0)$$

The mapping $\pi$ satisfies the following properties:

   P1. $\pi^2 = \pi$, and

   P2. $\pi(V) = W$.

We say that a linear mapping $\pi:V \to V$ is a *projection onto $W$* provided
that conditions P1 and P2 hold.

**Lemma:**
:   Suppose that $\pi:V \to V$ is a linear mapping.
    Then $\pi$ is projection onto $W$ if and only if $\pi(W)
    = W$ and the restriction of $\pi$ to $W$ is the identity mapping
    $\operatorname{id}_W$.

**Proof of Lemma:**
:   For a linear map $\pi:V \to V$ for which $\pi(V) = W$, we must
    show that $\pi^2 = \pi$ if and only if $\pi_{\mid W} =
    \operatorname{id}_W$.

    $(\Rightarrow)$: Suppose that $w \in W$. Since $\pi(V) = W$, we
    may write $w = \pi(v)$ for some $v \in V$. Then $\pi^2 = \pi$
    shows that $\pi^2(v) = \pi(v) \implies \pi(\pi(v)) = \pi(v)$ so
    that $\pi(w) = w$.
	
	$(\Leftarrow)$: Suppose that $v \in V$. We have $\pi(v) \in W$,
	and since $\pi_{\mid W}$ is the identity, we find $\pi^2(\pi(v)) =
	\pi(v)$. Since this holds for every $v$, we have $\pi^2 = \pi$ as
	required.

**Proposition:** 
:   There is a bijection between the following:
   
    - *complements* $W'$ to $W$ in $V$
	
	- projections $\pi:V \to V$ onto $W$

**Proof:**
:   We've already described how to build a projection $\pi$ from a complement $W'$.

    Given a projection $\pi$, take $W' = \ker \pi$. We must argue that
	$W'$ is a complement to $W$ in $V$.
	
	Suppose $x \in W \cap W'$. Since $x \in W$, the Lemma shows that
	$x = \pi(x)$.  But on the other hand since $x \in W' = \ker \pi$
	we find that $x = \pi(x) = 0$. This proves that $W \cap W' =
	\{0\}$.
	
	Finally we must show that $V = W + W'$. Let $v \in V$. Then $w =
	\pi(v) \in W$ by P2. Now, $$v = \pi(v) + (v - \pi(v)) = w + (v - \pi(v))$$ and it
	just remains to see that $v - \pi(v) \in W'$. But by P1,
	$$\pi(v-\pi(v)) = \pi(v) - \pi^2(v) = \pi(v) - \pi(v) = 0.$$


# Complete reducibility of $G$ representations.

Let $G$ be a finite group and $(\rho,V)$ a representation of $G$.

**Definition:**
:   We say that $(\rho,V)$ is *completely reducible* if for every
    subrepresentation $W \subseteq V$, there is a subrepresentation
    $W' \subseteq V$ such that $V$ is the internal direct sum of $W$
    and $W'$ as vector spaces.


**Theorem:**
:   Let $F$ be a field of char. 0 and let $G$ be a finite group. Then
    every representation of $G$ on a finite dimensional $F$-vector
    space is completely reducible.
	
**Proof:**
:   Let $(\rho,V)$ be a (finite dimensional) representation of $G$ and
    let $W \subset V$ be a *subrepresentation*.
	
	We *choose* a vector space complement, which by the Proposition
	above amounts to the choice of a projection operator $\pi:V \to V$
	onto the subspace $W$.
	
	We form a new linear mapping $$\widetilde \pi:V \to V$$ by the
	rule $$\widetilde \pi = \dfrac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) \circ
	\pi \circ \rho(g)^{-1}.$$

    We are going to prove: 
	
	(i) $\widetilde \pi$ is a homomorphism of $G$-representations, and
	
	(ii) $\widetilde \pi$ is a *projection*.

    Together (i) and (ii) imply the Theorem. Indeed, if (ii) holds,
	one knows that $W' = \ker \widetilde \pi$ is a *complement to $W$*. Since
	$\widetilde \pi$ is a homomorphism of $G$-representations, one knows
	that its kernel $W'$ is a subrepresentation.

    To prove (i), let $h \in G$ and $v \in V$ and observe
	
	\begin{align*}
	\widetilde \pi(\rho(h) v) &= \dfrac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} 
	\rho(g) \circ
	\pi \circ \rho(g)^{-1} (\rho(h) v) \\	
	&= \dfrac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} 
	\rho(g) \circ
	\pi \circ \rho(g^{-1}h) (v) \\
	&= \dfrac{1}{|G|} \sum_{x \in G} 
	\rho(hx) \circ \pi \circ \pi(x^{-1})(v) \\
	&= \dfrac{1}{|G|} \rho(h) \sum_{x \in G} \rho(x) \circ \pi \circ \rho(x)^{-1} (v) \\
	&= \rho(h) \widetilde \pi(v)
	\end{align*}

    Thus $\widetilde \pi$ is indeed a homomorphism of $G$-representations.
	
	To prove (ii), we observe that for each $g \in G$, the mapping
	$\rho(g) \circ \pi \circ \rho(g)^{-1}$ is also a projection onto
	$W$.  Indeed, since $W$ is a subrepresentation, $\rho(g)W = W$, so
	that $\rho(g) \circ \pi \circ \rho(g)^{-1}(V) \subseteq W$. On the
	other hand, since $\pi_{\mid W}$ is the identity mapping, $\rho(g)
	\circ \pi \circ \rho(g)^{-1}(w) = w$ for any $w\in W$ so the Lemma
	above shows that $\rho(g) \circ \pi \circ \rho(g){-1}$ is a
	projection onto $W$.
	
	Now it is clear that $\sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) \circ \pi \circ
	\rho(g^{-1})$ maps $V$ to $W$.  Since each mapping $\rho(g) \circ
	\pi \circ \rho(g^{-1})$ is the identity on $W$, it follows that
	$$\widetilde \pi = \dfrac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} \rho(g) \circ \pi
	\circ \rho(g^{-1})$$ is the identity mapping on $W$, so
	$\widetilde \pi$ is a projection by the Lemma above.

    This completes the proof of the Theorem.
