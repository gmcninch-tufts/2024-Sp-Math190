Let $G$ a finite group; we consider finite dimensional representations
of $G$ on $\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces.

# Previews!

Let $L_1,\cdots,L_m$ be a complete set of non-isomorphic irreducible
representations for the finite group $G$, and let $\chi_i$ be the
*character* of $L_i$.

Recall that *any* $G$-representation $V$ can be written as a direct sum of
irreducible subrepresentations:
$$G = \bigoplus_{j=1}^N S_j$$
where each $S_j$ is an irreducible representation.
For each $1 \le i \le m$, we say that the *multiplicity of $L_i$ in $V$*
-- written $[V:L_i]$ -- is the natural number given by
$$[V:L_i] = \#\{j \mid S_j \simeq L_i\}$$

Thus we have
$$V \simeq \bigoplus_{i=1}^m L_i^{\oplus [V:L_i]}$$
where the notation $W^{\oplus d}$ means
$$W^{\oplus d} = W \oplus W \oplus \cdots \oplus W \quad \text{($d$ copies)}.$$

Next week, we are going to sketch a proof of the following facts

**Theorem:**
:    a. The number $m$ of irreducible representations of $G$ is equal
        to the number of *conjugacy classes* in $G$.

     b. $\chi_1,\cdots,\chi_m$ are an *orthonormal basis* for the
        space $\operatorname{Cl}(G)$ of $\mathbb{C}$-value class
        functions on $G$.

     c. For any $G$-representation $V$, let $\chi$ be the character of $V$.
	    Then the multiplicity $[V:L_i]$ is given by
		$$[V:L_i] = \langle \chi,\chi_i\rangle.$$
		
		In particular, write $k_i = [V:L_i]$; then
		$$\chi = k_1 \chi_1 + k_2 \chi_2 + \cdots + k_m \chi_m.$$
		
	 d. The multiplicity with which $L_i$ appears in the *regular representation*
	    $F[G]$ is given by
		$$[F[G]:L_i] = \dim_F L_i.$$
		
		In particular, if $d_i = \dim_F L_i$, then
		$$|G| = \sum_{i=1}^m d_i^2.$$


# The Hermitian inner product on class functions, again

Enumerate the conjugacy classes of $G$, say $C_1,\cdots,C_m$ and choose a
representative $g_i \in C_i$ for each $i$.

Write $c_i = |C_G(g_i)|$ for the number of elements in
the centralizer of $g_i$, and notice that $$|\operatorname{Cl}(g_i)| =
|G|/|C_G(g_i)| = |G|/c_i.$$

Recall that for two class functions $f_1,f_2 \in \operatorname{Cl}(G)$ we have defined
$$\langle f_1,f_2 \rangle = \dfrac{1}{|G|} \sum_{g \in G} f_1(g) \overline{f_2(g)}.$$

**Lemma:**
:    We have
     $$\langle f_1,f_2 \rangle = \dfrac{1}{c_i} \sum_{i = 1}^m f_1(g) \overline{f_2(g)}.$$


# The character table.

The matrix is known as the *character table of the group $G$.*
Consider the $m \times m$ matrix whose rows are indexed by the
irreducible characters $\chi_1,\cdots,\chi_m$ and whose columns are
indexed by the conjugacy class representatives $g_1,\dots,g_m$, and
whose entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column is given by
$\chi_i(g_j)$. 
$$\begin{array}{l|llll}
& g_1 & g_2 & \cdots & g_m \\
& c_1 & c_2 & \cdots & c_m \\
\hline 
\chi_1 & \chi_1(g_1) & \chi_1(g_2) & \cdots & \chi_1(g_m) \\
\chi_2 & \chi_2(g_1) & \chi_2(g_2) & \cdots & \chi_2(g_m) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\chi_m & \chi_m(g_1) & \chi_m(g_2) & \cdots & \chi_m(g_m)
\end{array}$$

**Remark:** 
:   a. The fact that the $\chi_i$ form an orthonormal basis for the
       space $\operatorname{Cl}(G)$ is equivalent to the statement
       that the above matrix is *unitary*, in the sense that for $1
       \le i,j \le m$ we have

       $$\sum_{k=1}^m c_k \chi_i(g_k) \overline{\chi_j(g_k)} = \delta_{i,j}.$$

    b. Since the transpose of unitary matrix is also unitary, we find
       for $1 \le i,j \le m$ that
   
       $$\sum_{k=1}^m c_i \chi_k(g_i) \overline{\chi_k(g_j)} = \delta_{i,j}.$$

# We are now going to compute the character table for a few finite groups

## Cyclic groups

Let $G = \mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ for a natural number $N$. If $\zeta$
is a primitive $N$-th root of unity, we have for $0 \le i < N$ a homomorphism
$$\rho_i:G \to F^\times$$
determined by the equation
$$\rho_i(1 + N\mathbb{Z}) = \zeta^i.$$

Since $G$ is abelian, its conjugacy classes are *singletons*; thus the
number of irreducible representations is $N = |G|$.

Each $\rho_i$ determines a 1-dimensional irreducible representation,
and $i \ne j \implies \rho_i \not \simeq \rho_j$.

Orthonormality of characters implies that 
$$\langle \rho_i, \rho_j \rangle =  \delta_{i,j}$$

This equality can actually be deduce in a more elementary way. For
example, write $\trivial = \rho_0$.

Note that $$\langle \rho_1,\trivial \rangle
= \dfrac{1}{N}\sum_{i=0}^N \zeta^i = 0$$ since $\zeta$ is a root of
$\dfrac{T^N-1}{T-1} = T^N + T^{N-1} + \cdots + T + 1$.

Consider a function $f \in F[\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}]$. Using
orthonormality of characters we deduce 
$$f = \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \langle f, \rho_i \rangle \rho_i.$$

The assigment $i \mapsto \langle f,\rho_i \rangle$ is usual known
as the *discrete Fourier transform* of $f$.

## The group $D_6 = S_3$.

Let $G = S_3$ be the symmetric group on 3 letters, so that $|G| = 6$.

Note that the subgroup $H=\langle (123) \rangle \subset G$ has index 2
and is thus a *normal* subgroup. (In fact, $H$ is the *alternating
group* $A_3$).

Notice that the centralizer of $(123)$ coincides with $H$, so that
$(123)$ has exactly $[G:H] = 2$ conjugates (namely, $(123)$ and
$(132)$).  On the other hand, the centralizer of $(12)$ is $\langle
(12) \rangle$ so that $(12)$ has $3$ conjugates; namely $(12)$, $(13)$
and $(23)$.

Thus $1$, $(12)$, and $(123)$ is a full set of representatives for the
conjugacy classes of $G$. 

In particular, we expect to find 3 irreducible representations of $G$.

There are exactly two homomorphisms $G \to F^\times$ which contain $H$
in their kernel; one is the trivial mapping $\trivial$, and the other
is the sign homomorphism $\operatorname{sgn}:G \to F^\times$; it is
the unique mapping for which $H \subset \ker \operatorname{sgn}$ and
$\operatorname{sgn}((12)) = -1$.

Thus $\trivial$ and $\operatorname{sgn}$ are 1-dimensional irreducible
representations of $G$.

It remains to find one more irreducible representation.

Let $\Omega = \{1,2,3\}$ and consider the standard action of $G = S_3$
on $\Omega$. Write $\chi = \chi_\Omega$ for the *character* of this representation.

You will see for homework that $\chi(\sigma)$ is equal to the number
of fixed points of $\sigma$ on $\Omega$. 

We have seen that the trivial representation $\trivial$ appears in the representation
$F[\Omega]$; thus
$$F[\Omega] = W \oplus \trivial.$$

You will argue in homework that the character of $W$ is given by
$\psi = \chi - \trivial$.

Thus $\chi$ and $\chi - \trivial$ are given by:



$$\begin{array}{l|ll}
& \chi(\sigma) & \psi(\sigma) \\
\hline
1 & 3 & 2\\
(12) & 1 & 0 \\
(123) & 0 & -1
\end{array}$$

Now, we compute $$\langle \psi, \psi \rangle = 1/6 \cdot 2 \cdot 2 +
1/2 \cdot 0 \cdot 0 + 1/3 \cdot -1 \cdot -1 = 2/3 + 1/3 = 1$$ This
shows that $\psi$ is an irreducible representation. Thus the character
table of $G$ is given by

$$\begin{array}{l|llll}
& 1 & (12) & (123)  \\
& 6 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline 
\trivial & 1 & 1 & 1 \\
\operatorname{sgn} & 1 & -1 & 1 \\
\psi & 2 & 0 & 1 
\end{array}$$
