Let $G$ a finite group; we consider finite dimensional representations
of $G$ on $\mathbb{C}$-vector spaces.

# Previews!

Let $L_1,\cdots,L_m$ be the complete list of irreducible
representations for the finite group $G$, and let $\chi_i$ be the
*character* of $L_i$.

Next week, we are going to prove the following:

**Theorem:**
:    a. The number $m$ of irreducible representations of $G$ is equal
        to the number of *conjugacy classes* in $G$.

     b. $\chi_1,\cdots,\chi_m$ are an *orthonormal basis* for the
        space $\operatorname{Cl}(G)$ of $\mathbb{C}$-value class
        functions on $G$.

     c. For any $G$-representation $V$, let $\chi$ be the character of $V$.
	    

Enumerate the conjugacy classes of $G$, say $C_1,\cdots,C_m$ and choose a
representative $g_i \in C_i$ for each $i$.

Consider the $m \times m$ matrix whose rows are indexed by the
irreducible characters $\chi_1,\cdots,\chi_m$ and whose columns are
indexed by the conjugacy class representatives $g_1,\dots,g_m$, and
whose entry in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column is given by
$\chi_i(g_j)$. Write $c_i = |C_i|$ for the number of elements in the
$i$th conjugacy class.

This matrix is known as the *character table of the group $G$.*

$$\begin{array}{l|lll}
& g_1 & g_2 & \cdots & g_m \\
& c_1 & c_2 & \cdots & c_m \\
\hline 
\chi_1 & \chi_1(g_1) & \chi_1(g_2) & \cdots & \chi_1(g_m) \\
\chi_2 & \chi_2(g_1) & \chi_2(g_2) & \cdots & \chi_2(g_m) \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
\chi_m & \chi_m(g_1) & \chi_m(g_2) & \cdots & \chi_m(g_m)
\end{array}$$

**Remark:** 
:   a. The fact that the $\chi_i$ form an orthonormal basis for the
       space $\operatorname{Cl}(G)$ is equivalent to the statement
       that the above matrix is *unitary*, in the sense that for $1
       \le i,j \le m$ we have

       $$\sum_{k=1}^m c_k \chi_i(g_k) \overline{\chi_j(g_k)} = \delta_{i,j}.$$

    b. Since the transpose of unitary matrix is also unitary, we find
       for $1 \le i,j \le m$ that
   
       $$\sum_{k=1}^m c_i \chi_k(g_i) \overline{\chi_k(g_j)} = \delta_{i,j}.$$
