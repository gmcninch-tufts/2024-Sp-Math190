Let $G$ be a finite group, let $F$ be a field (algebraically closed, char. 0).

A representation of $G$ is a vector space $V$ together with a group
homomorphism $$\rho:G \to \operatorname{GL}(V).$$

If we choose a basis $\mathcal{B}$ of $V$, we obtain from $\rho$ an
assignment $g \mapsto [\rho(g)]_{\mathcal{B}}$ which is a group
homomorphism $G \to \operatorname{GL}_n(F)$.

## First example

Consider the finite cyclic group $G = \mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ for a
natural number $n > 0$.

Suppose that $M$ is an $m \times m$ matrix for which $M^n = \mathbf{I}$.
Using $M$, we get a representation
$$\rho_M:\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \to \operatorname{GL}_m(F)$$
by the rule
$$\rho_M(i + n \mathbb{Z}) = M^i.$$

One might consider the question: If $M$ and $M'$ are two $m \times m$
matrices for which $M^n = (M')^n = \mathbf{I}$, when are the
representations $\rho_M$ and $\rho_{M'}$ "the same"??

Consider the following $3\times 3$ matrices, each of which satisfies
$M^3 = \mathbf{I}$:

\begin{equation*}
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & 1 \\
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & 1 & 0 
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \zeta & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \zeta^2
\end{pmatrix},
\begin{pmatrix}
0 & 0 & -2 \\
3/2 & 0 & 0 \\
0 & -1/3 & 0 
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation*}
where $\zeta$ is a root of $\dfrac{T^3-1}{T-1} = T^2 + T + 1$. [^1]

In fact, all three of these matrices have eigenvalues
$1,\zeta,\zeta^2$ each with multiplicity 1.

[^1]: If $F = \mathbb{C}$ then we can take $\zeta = e^{2\pi i/3}$.

## Example: two commuting matrices

Suppose that $M,N$ are $m \times m$ matrices for which $M^n =
\mathbf{I}$, $N^k = \mathbf{I}$ and $MN = NM$.

We get a representation
$$\rho:\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}/k\mathbb{Z} \to \operatorname{GL}_m(F)$$
by the rule
$$\rho(i+n\mathbb{Z},j+k\mathbb{Z}) = M^iN^j.$$

*Remark*
:   Let $\mu$ be an eigenvalue of the matrix $M$, and let $V_\mu
    \subset F^m$ be the corresponding *eigenspace*.
	 
    Since $M$ and $N$ commute, a homework exercise shows that $V_\mu$
    is *invariant* under the action of $N$.
	
	Then $$N_{\mid V_\mu}:V_\mu \to V_\mu$$ is a linear transformation
	satisfying $(N_{\mid V_\mu})^k = \operatorname{id}$.
	
	In particular, we may choose a basis of $V_\mu$ of eigenvectors for $N_{\mid V_\mu}$

    In this way, we see that $V = F^m$ has a basis consisting of
	vectors which are simultaneously eigenvectors for $N$ and for $M$.

## Construction of representations from group actions

Suppose that the (finite) group $G$ acts on the (finite) set
$\Omega$. We are going to use this action to define a representation
of $G$.

We consider the vector space $F[\Omega]$ of all $F$-valued functions
on $\Omega$.

For $g \in G$, we consider the linear transformation
$$\rho(g):F[\Omega] \to F[\Omega]$$ 
defined for $f \in F[\Omega]$ by the rule
$$\rho(g)(f)(\omega) = f(g^{-1}\omega).$$


**Proposition:**
:   (a). $\rho(g)$ is an $F$-linear map.

    (b). $\rho(gh) = \rho(g)\rho(h)$ for $g,h \in G$. 
	
	(c). $\rho(g):F[\Omega] \to F[\Omega]$ is *invertible*.
	
**Proof of (b):**
:   Let $f \in F[\Omega]$. For $\tau \in \Omega$ we have
    $$\rho(gh)f(\tau) = f((gh)^{-1}\tau) =
	f(h^{-1}g^{-1}\tau) =
	\rho(h)f(g^{-1}\tau) =
	\rho(g)\rho(h)f(\tau).$$
	
	Since this holds for all $\tau$, conclude that
	$$\rho(gh)f = \rho(g)\rho(h)f.$$
	
	Since this holds for all $f$, conclude that $\rho(gh) =
    \rho(g)\rho(h)$ as required.
	
The Proposition shows that
$$\rho:G \to \operatorname{GL}(F[\Omega])$$
is a representation of $G$.

Here is an alternate perspective on $F[\Omega]$ and the action of $G$.

For $\omega \in \Omega$, consider the *Dirac* function
$\delta_\omega \in F[\Omega]$ defined by
$$\delta_\omega(\tau) = \left\{ \begin{matrix}
1 & \omega = \tau \\
0 & \text{else}
\end{matrix} \right.$$

**Proposition:**
:  The collection $\delta_\omega$ forms a *basis* for the $F$-vector
   space $F[\Omega]$.
   
**Sketch:**
:   For $f \in F[\Omega]$, we have
    $$f = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} f(\omega) \delta_\omega.$$
    This shows that the $\delta_\omega$ *span* $F[\Omega]$.   
   
    Now, suppose $0 = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} a_\omega \delta_\omega$
    for $a_\omega \in F$ for each $\omega \in \Omega$.
   
    To prove linear independence, we must argue that $a_\omega = 0$ for every $\omega$.
   
    Set $f = \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} a_\omega \delta_\omega$.  For
    $\tau \in \Omega$, the function $f$ satisfies $$f(\tau) =
    \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} a_\omega \delta_\omega(\tau) = a_\tau.$$
   
    Since $f = 0$ - i.e. "$f$ is the function which is takes value
    zero at every argument" -- we conclude that $a_\tau = 0$ for each
    $\tau$. This proves linear independence.

Let's consider the action of $G$ on these basis vectors. 

**Proposition:**
:   For $g \in G$ and $\omega \in \Omega$, we have
    $$\rho(g)\delta_\omega = \delta_{g \omega}.$$
	
**Proof:**
:   For $\tau \in \Omega$ we have
    $$\rho(g) \delta_\omega(\tau) = \delta_\omega(g^{-1}\tau)
	= \left\{ \begin{matrix}
    1 & \omega = g^{-1}\tau \\
	0 & \text{else}
	\end{matrix} \right.
	= \left\{ \begin{matrix}
	1 & g\omega = \tau \\
	0 & \text{else}
	\end{matrix} \right.$$
	
	This shows that $\rho(g)\delta_\omega(\tau) =
	\delta_{g\omega}(\tau)$; since this holds for all $\tau$ we
	conclude $\rho(g)\delta_\omega = \delta_{g\omega}$ as required.


**Remark:** 
:   Viewing $F[\Omega]$ as the vector space with basis $\delta_\omega$
    gives us a perhaps simpler proof that $\rho(gh) = \rho(g)\rho(h)$.

    Indeed, for $\omega \in \Omega$ we have $$\rho(gh)\delta_\omega =
	\delta_{gh \omega} = \rho(g)\delta_{h\omega} =
	\rho(g)(\rho(h)\delta_\omega) =
	\rho(g)\rho(h)\delta_\omega.$$


## Homomorphisms

Let $(\rho,V)$ and $(\psi,W)$ be representations of $G$.  a linear
mapping $\Phi:V \to W$ is a *homomorphism of $G$-representations*
provided that for every $v \in V$ and for every $g \in G$ we have
$$\Phi(\rho(g)v) = \psi(g) \Phi(v).$$

The $G$-representations $(\rho,V)$ and $(\psi,W)$ are isomorphic is
there is a homomorphism of $G$-representations which is *invertible*.

### Example

For any $G$ one has the so-called *trivial representation* $\mathbb{1}.$
This representation has vector space $V = F$ (it is 1 dimensional!) and the mapping
$$G \to \operatorname{GL}(V) = \operatorname{GL}_1(F) = F^\times$$
is just the trivial homomorphism $g \mapsto 1$.

One often writes $\mathbb{1}$ for the *underlying vector space* $F$.

Let $G$ act on the (finite) set $\Omega$. Then there is a homomorphism
of $G$-representations $$\mathbb{1} \to F[\Omega].$$
Viewing $\mathbb{1} = F$, the scalar $c$ is mapped
to the *constant function with value $c$.*

Put another way, the scalar $c$ is mapped to the vector
$$c \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \delta_\omega.$$
