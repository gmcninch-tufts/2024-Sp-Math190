# Cyclic codes: definitions

Consider a linear code $C \subset \F_q^n$. Then $C$ is said to be *cyclic*
if  $$(c_0,c_1,\cdots,c_{n-1}) \in C \implies
(c_{n-1},c_0,c_1,\cdots,c_{n-2}) \in C.$$

Observe that there is an isomorphism of vector spaces
$$\F_q^n \to \F_q[T]/\langle T^n -1 \rangle$$
given by the assignment
$$\phi(c_0,c_1,\cdots,c_{n-1}) = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i T^i.$$

Here $\F_q[T]/\langle T^n -1 \rangle$ denotes the quotient of the
polynomial ring $\F_q[T]$ by the (principal) ideal generated by $T^n
-1$. Elements of $\F_q[T]/\langle T^n -1 \rangle$ are additive cosets
$f + \langle T^n -1 \rangle$ for $f \in \F_q[T]$; we have
$$f + \langle T^n -1 \rangle = g + \langle T^n -1 \rangle$$
if and only if $f -g \in \langle T^n -1\rangle$; i.e.  if and only if
$T^n -1 | f -g$.

We are going to identify $C$ and its image in $\F_q[T]/\langle T^n -1 \rangle$;
from this point of view, each codeword in $C$ is represented by a  unique
polynomial $f \in \F_q[T]$ with $\deg f < n$.

Let's write $A = \F_q[T]/\langle T^n - 1 \rangle$. Recall that an *ideal*
of the ring $A$ is a linear subspace $I \subseteq A$ with the property that
$$f \cdot I \subseteq I \quad \forall f \in A$$
i.e. $f g \in I$ for all $f \in A$ and all $g \in I$.

**Remark**
:   The weight of a vector $f = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i T^i \in A$ is of course
    given by $\operatorname{weight}(f) = \#\{j \mid a_j \ne 0\}.$ 

**Lemma**
:   A subspace $I \subseteq A$ is an ideal if and only if $T \cdot I \subseteq I$.

**Proof of Lemma**
:   Let $I \subseteq A$ be a linear subspace. If $I$ is an ideal, then by definitions
    we know that $T \cdot I \subseteq I$.
   
    Suppose on the other hand that $T \cdot I \subset I$.  Fix $f =
    \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} a_i T^i \in A$ where $a_i \in F_q$, and let $g
    \in I$. We have to argue that $fg \in I$.
   
    By assumption we know that $T g \in I$, and by an easy induction
    we see that $T^j g \in I$ for all $j \ge 0$. Now
    $$fg = \sum_{i=0}^n a_i T^i g \in I$$ since $I$ is a *linear subspace* of $A$.


**Proposition**
:   The code $C$ is *cyclic* if and only if $C$ is an ideal when viewed
    as a subspace of $A=\F_q[T]/\langle T^n - 1 \rangle$.
	
**Proof**
:   For a polynomial $f = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i T^i \in A$, notice that
    $$T \cdot f = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} c_i T^{i+1} = c_{n-1} + c_0 T + c_1
    T^2 + \cdots + c_{n-2} T^{n-1}$$ *since* $T^n = 1$ in $A$.

    Note that $f$ corresponds to $(c_0,c_1,\cdots,c_{n-1})$ and
	$Tf$ corresponds to $(c_{n-1},c_0,\cdots,c_{n-2})$.
	
	Thus $C$ is cyclic iff $T C \subseteq C$; by the Lemma, this last
	condition is equivalent to the condition that $C$ is an ideal of
	$A$.


We recall the important result: 

**Theorem**
:   Let $F$ be a field
    
	a. The polynomial ring $F[T]$ is a principal ideal domain.
	   Thus if $I$ is an ideal of $F[T]$,  there is $f \in I$ with
	   $$I = \langle f \rangle = \{fh \mid h \in F[T]\} = f F[T].$$

    b. For any ideal $I$ of $F[T]$, the quotient ring $F[T]/I$ is also
       a principal ideal domain.
	
	c. In particular, $A = \F_q[T]/\langle T^n - 1 \rangle$ is a
       principal ideal domain.

**Proof of b**
:   Recall that ideals of $F[T]/I$ are in one-to-one correspondence
    with ideals of $F[T]$ which contain $I$.
	
	In fact, if $I \subseteq J \subseteq F[T]$ with $J$ an ideal, the
	ideal of $F[T]/I$ corresponding to $J$ is $J/I = \{h + I \mid h
	\in J\}$. Since $J = \langle f \rangle = fF[T]$ is principal,
	also $J/I = \langle f + J \rangle = (f+J)(F[T]/J)$ is principal.
	
	
# Cyclic codes via polynomials

Let $C \subset A = \F_q[T]/\langle T^n - 1 \rangle$ be a cyclic code
of length $n$. Since $C$ is an *ideal* of $A$, there is a polynomial
$g$ with $\deg(g) < n$ for which
$C = \langle g \rangle.$

We will always choose $g$ to be *monic* and of minimal degree among
polynomials in $C$.

**Proposition**
:   If $C = \langle g \rangle$ with $g$ monic of minimal degree, then
    $g \mid T^n -1$ in $\F_q[T]$.
	
**Proof**
:   Working in the polynomial ring $\F_q[T]$, let $h =
    \gcd(g,T^n-1)$. Thus
	
	- $h \mid g$, 
	- $h \mid T^n -1$, and 
	- for any polynomial $f$ satisfing $f \mid g$ and $f \mid T^n -1$,
      we have $f \mid h$.

    It is an important fact that $h$ may be written
	$$(*) \quad h = a \cdot g + b \cdot (T^n -1) \quad \text{for $a,b \in \F_q[T]$}.$$
	
	For clarity, I'm going to write (for the Lemma only) $[f]$ for the 
	element of the quotient ring $A$ represented by $f \in \F_q[T]$.
	
	Now, if $g$ does not divide $T^n-1$, then $\deg h < \deg g$.
	
	On the other hand, working in the quotient ring  $A = \F_q[T]/\langle T^n - 1
    \rangle$, $(*)$ shows that $[h] = a \cdot [g] \in \langle [g] \rangle$.
	
	Thus $h$ is a polynomial with $[h] \in C$ having strictly smaller degree
	than $g$, contradicting the fact that $g$ has minimal degree among
	polynomials in $C$. 
	
	This contradiction shows that $g \mid T^n - 1$.

**Example**
:   Let $0 \le i < n$ and consider the ideal $\langle T^i \rangle$ of
    $A = \F_q[T]/\langle T^n - 1 \rangle.$
	
	Notice that $T^i$ (or more precisely, the the element of $A$
	determined by the coste $T^i + \langle T^n -1 \rangle$) is a
	*unit* in $A$, since $$T^i \cdot T^{n-i} = 1 \quad \text{in
	$A$}$$
	(i.e. $T^i \cdot T^{n-i} \equiv T^n \equiv 1 \pmod{T^n - 1}$).

    Thus $1 \in \langle T^i \rangle$ so that $\langle T^i \rangle =
    \langle 1 \rangle = A$. 
	
	In particular, the minimal degree representative for the ideal
    $\langle T^i \rangle$ is $1 = T^0$.

**Proposition**
:   Let $F$ be any field, let $f,g \in F[T]$ and suppose that $g \mid f$.
    Form the quotient ring $B = F[T]/\langle f \rangle$. Then
	$$\dim_F\langle g \rangle = \dim_F gB = \deg f - \deg g.$$

**Proof**
:   Note that $g \mid f \implies \langle f \rangle \subseteq \langle g
    \rangle$.  Now, basic properties of the polynomial ring tell us
    that $\dim B = \dim F[T]/\langle f \rangle = \deg f$. 
	
	(Indeed, the cosets $T^i + \langle f \rangle$ for $0 \le i < \deg
    f$ form an $F$-basis).

    One of the *Isomorphism Theorems* tells us that the quotient ring
    $B/gB = B/\langle g \rangle$ may be identified with $F[T]/\langle
    g \rangle$; indeed, the natural mapping
	
	$$B/gB = \dfrac{F[T]/\langle f \rangle}{\langle g \rangle /
    \langle f \rangle} \to F[T]/\langle g \rangle$$
	is a ring isomorphism.
    In particular, we see that $\dim B/gB = \deg g$.
	
	Our goal is to compute the dimension of $gB = \langle g \rangle$.
	Of course, *as linear spaces* $$B \simeq \langle g \rangle
	\oplus (B/\langle g \rangle);$$ this shows that $$\dim \langle g
	\rangle = \dim B - \dim (B/\langle g \rangle) = \deg f - \deg.$$


We get at once:

**Corollary**
:   If $g \in \F_q[T]$ and $g$ divides $T^n - 1$, then the ideal
    $\langle g \rangle \subset A = \F_q[T]/\langle T^n - 1 \rangle$
    has dimension $$\dim \langle g \rangle = \dim gA = n - \deg g.$$

In particular, we see that a polynomial $g \mid T^n -1$ determines a
code with paramters $[n,n-\deg g]_q$
